# Project Logbook

## 25. of April

- S3 Bucket Setup:
    
    Created an S3 bucket to host a static website on AWS.
    Configured the bucket's properties to enable static website hosting.
    Set up a bucket policy to allow public read access to the objects in the bucket.

- Website Deployment:
        
    Created a GitHub repository to store the website files.
    Set up a GitHub Actions workflow using a YAML file (s3_deploy.yml) to automate the deployment process.
    Used the AWS CLI within the workflow to sync the local files to the S3 bucket.

- Self-hosted Google Fonts:
    Identified the usage of Google Fonts by checking the HTML files for links to fonts.gstatic.com and fonts.googleapis.com.
    Downloaded the required font files (Open Sans and Poppins) from Google Fonts.
    Added the downloaded font files to the website's file structure.
    Created the appropriate @font-face declarations in the CSS file, linking to the locally hosted font files.
    Removed the external Google Fonts links from the HTML files.

- Testing and Verification:
    Checked the website to ensure that it's working correctly and using the self-hosted fonts.
    Used Google Chrome's Developer Tools to verify that the font requests were being made to the local files hosted on the S3 bucket.

With these steps, the website has been successfully deployed to an S3 bucket, and Google Fonts have been self-hosted to improve performance and privacy for visitors.
